# Linear-Regression

A Simple program that uses **Linear regression** to predict the predictor variable.

The program is pretty self-explanatory, there are two ways to predict:
1. Using the values in the current dataset values
2. Pass the values in the __test__ list, which is by the way commented out.

The output gives the predicted values and the RMS Error values, as well as a plot to show the **regression line** and the scatterplot of the prior values. 

I did not use Pandas, so it will be a little slow and can give exceptions for a large amount of data.

* Modules used:
    1. matplotlib
    2. csv
    3. math
    4. operator
